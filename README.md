![Rainbow Test on PCB](images/DADA_Grid_4x4_RainbowTest.JPG)

This is a library for the DADA Grid 4x4 PCB based on the Design of Adafruit Trellis

![PCB front](images/DADA_Grid_4x4_front.png)

up to 8 PCB can share the same I2C Bus to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface, 
i2c Address must be set by the solder jumpers on the back of the PCB. 
i2c Addresses 0x20-0x27
